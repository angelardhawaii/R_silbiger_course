#verify that all below point to the same function object
lobstr::obj_addr(mean) # mean in base R is a generic function to get the trimmed arithmetic mean
lobstr::obj_addr(base::mean) # currently unclear what this exactly does
lobstr::obj_addr(get("mean")) #get in base R returns the value of a named object
lobstr::obj_addr(evalq(mean)) #evalq evaluates an R expression in a specified environment
lobstr::obj_addr(match.fun(mean)) #match.fun extracts a function specified by name
