#1. calculate the mean and variance of body mass by species, island, and sex, without NAs
pen_means_var <- penguins %>% #assign new dataframe to a new name
  drop_na(sex) %>% #drop the NAs first
  group_by(species, island, sex) %>% #group by, as the name suggests
  summarise(mean_bm = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), #tell the code what you want to see in the group
            var_bm = var(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) #will return a table with mean and variance by the groupings
view(pen_means_var)

            
#2. filter out male penguins then calculate the log body mass, then select only the columns for species, island, sex and
#log body mass, then use these data to make any plot, Make sure the plot has clean
#and clear labels and follows best practices. Save the plot in the correct output folder.
male_log_body <- penguins %>%
  filter(sex == "male") %>% #get males only
  mutate(log_body_mass = log(body_mass_g)) %>% #make a new column based on the log of body mass
  select(species, island, sex, log_body_mass) #new dataframe will have only these variables per the previous steps

#I want to view the mean on the plot. This gets a mean of log_body_mass
mean_log_body <- mean(male_log_body$log_body_mass)

#make a plot to display the data
